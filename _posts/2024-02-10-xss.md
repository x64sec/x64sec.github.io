# Understanding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a common web security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This vulnerability occurs when an application accepts user input without proper validation or sanitization and then includes that input in its output dynamically.

## How XSS Works

In a typical XSS attack scenario, an attacker crafts a malicious script, often JavaScript code, and injects it into a vulnerable web page. This script is then executed in the context of the victim's browser when they visit the compromised page. Depending on the attacker's intentions, XSS attacks can range from simple defacement of web pages to stealing sensitive information such as session cookies or login credentials.

### Types of XSS

There are three main types of XSS attacks:

1. **Reflected XSS**: In a reflected XSS attack, the malicious script is embedded in the URL and is reflected back to the user by the web application.

2. **Stored XSS**: In a stored XSS attack, the malicious script is stored on the server and is served to users whenever they access the compromised page.

3. **DOM-based XSS**: DOM-based XSS occurs when the client-side script modifies the Document Object Model (DOM) in an unsafe way, leading to a security vulnerability.

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int sayi = 10;

    if (sayi > 0) {
        printf("Sayi pozitif.\n");
    } else if (sayi < 0) {
        printf("Sayi negatif.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Sayi sifir.\n");
    }

    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Döngü değeri: %d\n", i);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Preventing XSS Attacks

Preventing XSS attacks requires a combination of input validation, output encoding, and proper security configurations. Some common mitigation techniques include:

- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize user input on both client and server sides to ensure that it conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious code.
- **Output Encoding**: Encode user-generated content before rendering it in web pages to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which scripts can be executed on a web page.
- **XSS Filters**: Use web application firewalls or built-in browser XSS filters to detect and block malicious script injections.

## Conclusion

XSS attacks pose a significant threat to web applications and their users. By understanding how XSS attacks work and implementing appropriate security measures, developers can mitigate the risk of XSS vulnerabilities and protect against potential exploitation.

Remember, ensuring the security of web applications is an ongoing process, and staying vigilant against emerging threats is crucial in maintaining a secure online environment.

Stay safe, and happy coding!
